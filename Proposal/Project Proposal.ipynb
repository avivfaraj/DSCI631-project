    "### Initial  Feature Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Borough** is the borough in which the unit is located: '1':'Manhattan', '2':'Bronx', '3': 'Brooklyn', '4':'Queens','5':'Staten Island'. Location is a key feature in real estate, and this is especially true in NYC. For the purposes of exploratory analysis, we have converted the numeric values into their proper names.  Below you will see a clear distinction in price by neighborhood, with Manhattan being much more expensive. For constructing the model we will likely one hot encode.<br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Neighborhood** is the specific neighborhood within the borough. There is a strong relationship with neighborhood and sale price. Much like borough, because the neighborhoods are not explicitly ranked, a one hot coding strategy will likely be used.<br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Building Class Category** is an important feature as it separates between attached and unattached houses or elevator apartments.<br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Tax class a present** is the tax class and is heavily correlated with both sale price and tax class at time of sale. Tax class and number of units as correlated as the tax class depends on how may units. There is a big risk of data leakage with this feature. The models real world success would depend on accurately determining the tax class before selling or purchasing a property. Because of this, we may want to remove this feature.\n",
    "[Source](https://blocksandlots.com/property-taxes-in-nyc-all-you-need-to-know/)<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Block and Lot** The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL\n",

    "“The Building Classification is used to describe a property’s constructive use. The first position of the Building Class is a letter that is used to describe a general class of properties (for example “A” signifies one-family homes, “O” signifies office buildings. “R” signifies condominiums). The second position, a number, adds more specific information about the property’s use or construction style (using our previous examples “A0” is a Cape Cod style one family home, “O4” is a tower type office building and “R5” is a commercial condominium unit). The term Building Class used by the Department of Finance is interchangeable with the term Building Code used by the Department of Buildings.”\n",

    "1. **Address** Is the actual address. Because of the variance we will remove this feature. However, it could be potentially used to crosswalk longitude and latitude, but that would require an additional dataset.<br><br>\n",

    "1. **Zip Code** Zip codes are difficult to work with in machine learning problems because it’s an integer and a higher or lower zip code won’t necessarily mean it’s better or worse. If we are going to use it we will one hot encode.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Residential Units** are the number of residential units for sale. This is correlated with price as 8 units will likely cost more than 2 in a similar neighborhood. For exploratory analysis we examine the price per unit.<br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Land Square Feet** is the land area of the property. This is a valuable feature for predicting price.<br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Gross Square Feet** According to nyc.gov: “The total area of all the floors of a building as measured from the exterior surfaces of the outside walls of the building, including the land area and space within any building or structure on the property.”  This is also a valuable feature for predicting price. However, it’s important for compare between this and location as a smaller property in the center of Manhattan, may be more expensive than a much larger property in Staten Island.<br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Year Built** is the year the structure was built. Many of the properties were built a long time ago, but it’s worth further testing this feature before elimination. \n",
    "Tax class at time of sale: See above for tax class. It will be difficult to accurately predict this and it has a very high risk of data leakage. This feature will almost certainly be removed.<br><br>\n",
